            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Hornets are a type of wasp and they are predators of honey bees. 
                While they may not directly attack a bee hive, they can hunt individual bees and their larvae.
                 Hornets can also compete with honey bees for food sources, such as nectar and pollen. 
                 As a result, they can reduce the number of resources available to the honey bee population.
                HOW DO HORNETS KILL BEES :
                Hornets employ a range of tactics in their attacks on honey bees.  
                 Predators can kill bees by using their stingers and injecting venom into the bee's body. The venom causes paralysis and death.                                                                                        They may also attack and kill bees by biting them or using their mandibles to tear them apart.                                     Some hornet species are known for deadly mass attacks on nests or hives, killing many bees and destroying colonies.
                How Honey Bees Defend Their Nests And Hives Against Hornets:
                Honey bees have developed a range of defence strategies to ward off attacks.   
                  For exapmle they defend themselves against the predatory insects by forming a defensive ball around the intruder.
                   When a hornet approaches a hive, the honey bees will form a tight ball around the hornet, vibrating their flight muscles
                    to generate heat and suffocate the predator.
